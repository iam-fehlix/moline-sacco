**SOME LOGICS**

The vehicles will be called Matatus (a popular Kenyan name for vehicles transporting people from point to point). Singular is Matatu. 

A Matatu owner and Staff are the only ones allowed to take loans. Savings are only done by the matatu owners. A matatu owner can also be a staff and can have more than one matatu.

There are two types of loans; the **Normal Loan** and the **Emergency Loan**. 

For one to qualify for the Normal Loan, s/he should be fully registered and must have paid a sum of `KES 15000` as share capital and must have savings. One can apply a normal of up-to the amounts saved and not more. The emergency loan has a maximum value of `KES 30000`. If a matatu owner wants a loan that is more than their current savings, then s/he must nominate a guarantor or guarantors whose savings can add up to the amount s/he needs. 

A matatu owner is allowed to apply for the two loans separately as well.

Each matatu owner pays a given value e.g. `250KES` daily towards the insurance docket for each vehicle. This money is for the vehicle's insurance that must be a given value e.g. `6500KES` by the following month same date. So the insurance  for each vehicle is active until the same date the next month after which the actuary officer will suspend the vehicle if the total amount in the insurance docket is less than the set amount e.g. 6500KES.

Each matatu will have a one specific status on registration into the system: 
- Active (In operation and no balances due for the Insurance docket), 
- Inactive (If the owner removes it from the company) or
- Suspended (When insurance has expired and/or not paid for or if the amount in the Insurance docket is less than the set value e.g. `6500KES` on the expiry date)

The staff will have **Salaries** paid to their accounts but **NHIF** (National Health Insurance Fund) or **SHIF** (Social Health Insurance Fund) amounts will be deducted each month before salaries are paid and payslips generated.

Apart from `Salaries`, there are also `Wages` that are paid on a daily basis to individuals who work in the office.
